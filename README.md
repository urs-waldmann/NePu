# Install

All experiments with NePu were run using CUDA version 11.6 and the official pytorch docker image `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.02-py3`, as published by nvidia [here](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:pytorch).
However, as the model is solely based on simple, common mechanisms, older CUDA and pytorch versions should also work. Additonally we rely on the ```imageio```library, which can be easily installed via ```pip```or ```conda```.

TODO: Alternatively, we provide the `nepu_env.yaml` file that holds all python requirements for this project. To conveniently install them automatically with anaconda you can use:
```
conda env create -f nepu_env.yml
conda activate nepu
```


# Datasets

TODO

# Demo

TODO

# Training

To train NePu please run 

``` python train.py -exp_name EXP_NAME -cfg_file CFG_FILE -data DATA_TYPE```

where the ```CFG_FILE``` is the path to a ```.yaml```-file specifiying the configurations, describes in more detail [here](todo-insert-link-here). ```DATA_TYPE```can be one of the categories of our synthetic dataset, namely ```giraffe, pigeon, cow, human```.


# Rendering

To render multiple views of the test set run 

``` python test.py -exp_name EXP_NAME -checkpoint CKPT -data DATA_TYPE ```

where ```CKPT``` specifies the epoch of the trained weights.
TODO: custom and novel views

# Inverse-Rendering

For our inverse-rendering-based 3D keypoint detection run

```
python sil2kps.py -exp_name EXP_NAME -checkpoint CKPT -cams CAM_IDS -data DATA_TYPE 
```

where ```CAM_IDS``` spcifies the views used for 3D keypoint detection and the other command line arguments are the same as above.
